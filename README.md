# deeplearning

Architecture of some algorithms of deep learning from scratch using python and some of its libraries. 

## Getting Started

As a study exercicie, I'm going to implement some basic algorithms. Starting with perceptron.

```
numpy==1.16.4
```

For instance:
```
 perceptron.ipynb
```

## Built With

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - The framework used
